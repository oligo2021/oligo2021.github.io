### Maastricht

Maastricht is the capital of the Province of Limburg located in the southeast of the Netherlands and in the centre of the Meuse-Rhine Euregion, a stone’s throw from Liège and Aachen. Maastricht developed from a Roman settlement to a Medieval religious centre, a garrison town and an early industrial city. Today, Maastricht is well-regarded as an affluent cultural centre. Maastricht draws many tourists who come to enjoy the city’s beauty and history. The city centre is especially attractive, with historical buildings and more than 1,450 listed buildings. Visitors enjoy the relaxed, exuberant atmosphere.

We look forward to welcome you all virtually in Maastricht in June 2021.
