# School of Business & Economics, Maastricht University
{: .fs-9 }

The conference will take place in the School of Business & Economics on the Maastricht University campus.
Founded in 1984, SBE is currently the largest faculty of Maastricht University in student numbers. 

Housed in a former Jesuit monastery, the school currently provides education to around 4,200 students, of which 60% are international. 
As a business school, SBE is accredited by EQUIS, AACSB and the Association of MBAs. This triple accreditation has only been achieved by 1% of business schools worldwide. 
SBEâ€™s approach revolves around small-scale teaching methods, a portfolio of international study programmes, and strong incentives for top-quality research. 
The focus lies on educational innovation. All degree programmes make use of the Problem Based approach, with an emphasis on skills development - problem solving, group work, and self-directed learning - to prepare students optimally for the European and international knowledge society.
